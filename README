Currently this runs with Ubuntu and QGIS 3.28. I know these two things need to set for MAC and I assume more needs to be set: 

*   `QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/Applications/QGIS-LTR.app/Contents/MacOS",True)`

*   `sys.path.append("/Applications/QGIS-LTR.app/Contents/Resources/python/plugins")`

Script is loaded up here as test.py. To run: `/Applications/QGIS-LTR.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/python3 test.py` 

The end result will be the help for the grass7:v.buffer command.
